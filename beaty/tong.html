<p>Scheduling plays an important role in data science, as scheduling is the
allocation of various resources for processing the data with one or more
optimization goals. Common applications can be found in the manufacturing
industries, as well for airline and package delivery companies. In
addition, complex scheduling problems frequently arise in the increasingly
popular Internet-of-Things (IoT) and cloud computing, where computational
recourses need to be assigned to achieve the overall computation
efficiency. In this presentation, an interesting scheduling problem,
Parallel Multi-stage Flow-shops, will be introduced. In the parallel
k-stage flow-shops problem, we are given m identical k-stage flow-shops and
a set of jobs. Each job can be processed by any one of the flow-shops but
switching between flow-shops is not allowed. The objective is to minimize
the makespan, which is the finishing time of the last job. This problem is
motivated by an application in cloud computing. Due to its NP-hardness, we
concentrated on its approximability and proposed the current best
approximation algorithms for two cases. </p>
