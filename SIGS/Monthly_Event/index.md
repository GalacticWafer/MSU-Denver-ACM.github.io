 Abstract:  
 Coming from a data science type of position at a large tech company, back to an academic setting at an institution such as MSU Denver, itâ€™s natural to hear questions about what these roles are like, how they vary, what skills are needed, etc. This talk will share a personal perspective on the range of data science roles in industry, focusing largely on the online advertising and market research domains. It will then delve into personal experiences/projects as a research-oriented data scientist at Facebook and eBay, including the creation and implementation of statistical methods and tools to enable and/or improve software products used for quantifying the effects of advertising on consumer behavior.
