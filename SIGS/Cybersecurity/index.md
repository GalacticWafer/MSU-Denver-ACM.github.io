### Past Events <br>

***Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)*** - *Using Open-Source Tools to Find Vulnerable Targets*<br>
*by Stephen Chavez, Cybersecurity Researcher<br>
Friday, March 15th, 2019<br>
12:00 - 1:00pm*
<br>

> Stephen was the first MSU Denver graduate to present at the world's largest hacker conference, DEFCON 24 in 2016. He focuses on being an infosec researcher targeting medical devices like power-wheelchairs. He presented a complex attack that allowed him to control a power-wheelchair remotely. His research has been internationally recognized and is being used by universities like MIT and U.C Berkeley. In recent times, he is learning threat intelligence. <br/> [9News story on Mr. Chavez](https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/storytellers/storytellers-meet-msu-denvers-hotshot-hacker/73-370552323) <br/>

The Internet is an ocean of data which is an advantage as well as a disadvantage. Pros are that the internet is free and accessible to everyone unless restricted by an organization or law. The Internet has all the information readily available for anyone to access. Cons are that the information is available that can be misused by someone with a malicious intent, or in the case of infosec researchers fixing holes. We as researchers need to know what network resources are available for assessments.  
Stephen will show how to use such tools to search and identify vulnerable real-world targets.<br>
