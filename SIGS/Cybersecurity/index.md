## Next Event <br>
***IoT Is Not Spelled NO!*** - *IoT Challenges from a CISO’s Perspective* <br>
*by Rock Lambros, CEO RockCyber<br>
Friday, April 19, 2019<br>
12:00 - 1:00pm*
<br>
> As the CEO and Founder of RockCyber, LLC, I am seasoned Cybersecurity and Information Technology executive with 20 years of experience in aligning Cybersecurity and technology strategy with enterprise business goals in order to reduce the risk of revenue to the organization. This includes building security programs, architecture, operations, threat intelligence, governance, risk management, compliance and incident response for (multi-billion dollar) global organizations with exceptional security requirements. My enterprise experience has spanned industries with vastly differing security and privacy requirements including energy, eCommerce, government, banking, and manufacturing. <br> [Rock's LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rocklambros/) <br> [RockCyber Website](https://rockcyber.com/) <br/>

The IoT train is already here. The business is already pounding down IT’s and Security’s door for IoT solutions that will allow the business to be better/faster/stronger. Planning for an IoT implementation raises many challenges, the least of which is that IoT typically requires a complex, blended approach of different architectures with IT, OT and physical security. Security leaders must understand these challenges, business drivers, technology drivers and market drivers when developing their IoT security strategy. Security leaders must partner with multiple business units to ensure a successful IoT deployment. We will examine some of the unique challenges and trends of a secure and successful IoT deployment, and a few real-world examples of IoT deployments that have improved business processes.

### Past Events <br>

***Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)*** - *Using Open-Source Tools to Find Vulnerable Targets*<br>
*by Stephen Chavez, Cybersecurity Researcher<br>
Friday, March 15th, 2019<br>
12:00 - 1:00pm*
<br>

> Stephen was the first MSU Denver graduate to present at the world's largest hacker conference, DEFCON 24 in 2016. He focuses on being an infosec researcher targeting medical devices like power-wheelchairs. He presented a complex attack that allowed him to control a power-wheelchair remotely. His research has been internationally recognized and is being used by universities like MIT and U.C Berkeley. In recent times, he is learning threat intelligence. <br/> [9News story on Mr. Chavez](https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/storytellers/storytellers-meet-msu-denvers-hotshot-hacker/73-370552323) <br/>

The Internet is an ocean of data which is an advantage as well as a disadvantage. Pros are that the internet is free and accessible to everyone unless restricted by an organization or law. The Internet has all the information readily available for anyone to access. Cons are that the information is available that can be misused by someone with a malicious intent, or in the case of infosec researchers fixing holes. We as researchers need to know what network resources are available for assessments.  
Stephen will show how to use such tools to search and identify vulnerable real-world targets.<br>
